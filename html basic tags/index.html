            alt= printable text if the image is not found at src
            [titie= tool tip text for the image]

            drive:/folder/.../filename.ext
            relative address begins at a specific point
            for web sites, it is the "top of the website"

            same folder 
            =filename.extension

            lower folder
            ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextleveldownfoldername/.../filename.ext"
